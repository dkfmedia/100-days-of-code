# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 7th 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked in a JavaScript Domain generator project, I added a shuffle function to a list generator. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with JavaScript, that's why I wanna keep working on it.

### Day 2: December 8th 2023

**Today's Progress**: Created basic HTML site, that's supposed to change the background color everytime the "Generate" button is clicked. 

**Thoughts**: I thought it was working flawlessly, however the JavaScript portion was not really working, tried to make changes to it and when trying to do git push I received an issue. Let's try again tomorrow.



### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
